# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction to task

Hey, first of all i'd like to thank you for task and opportunity!

I suggest that this is the last page where user gets results of his/her inputs before.

It works like a quiz/question_set so we can get some inputs to display it all later.

I suppose some additional calculations are required to count some stuff in the end, but it's important to see the whole picture.

Moreover, you can see that I've suggested layout for tablet devices as well.

## Improvements/Suggestions to make app better

It would be nice to improve graph element - so it would dynamically appear/put dots on specific spots and etc.

Moreover, it will be fun to add some nice animations to "Personal summary" section.

Also, i guess it wil be fun to make Calendar element to be clickable. So let's say each day represents amount of kilos lost.

And as the final thing - i'd add a modal box when clicking on a "Start" CTAs with email input, so it will be kinda a dymanic web app.
