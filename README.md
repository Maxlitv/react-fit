# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction to task

I suggest that this is the last page where the user gets the results of his/her inputs before.

It works like a quiz/question_set so we can get some inputs to display it all later.

I suppose some additional calculations are required to count some stuff in the end, but it's important to see the whole picture.

Moreover, you can see that I've suggested a layout for tablet devices as well.

## Improvements/Suggestions to make app better

It would be nice to improve the graph element - so it would dynamically appear/put dots on specific spots, etc.

Moreover, it will be fun to add some nice animations to the "Personal Summary" section.

Also, I guess it will be fun to make the Calendar element to be clickable. So let's say each day represents the number of kilos lost.

And as the final thing - I'd add a modal box when clicking on a "Start" CTAs with email input, so it will be kinda a dynamic web app.
